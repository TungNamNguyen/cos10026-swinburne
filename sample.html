		<h1>Welcome to Coffee Script </h1>
		<section>
			<h2>A brief introduction to coffescript</h2>
			<p>
				Coffee script is programming language that compiles to JavaScript. </br>It was first introduced in December 13,2009, by American Computer scientist Jeremy Ashkenas who produced Coffee Script as an attempt to simplify and modernize an existing programming language known as ‘Java Script’

				Now if you don’t know what JavaScript is, this is what it is in a nutshell.</br> It is a coding language used to develop and manage the behaviour of websites, where programmers can implement features such as navigation buttons, imagery, and other functions to allow users to interact with webpages.</br> As such JavaScript is the commonly seen coding language in the world
			</p>
			<p>
				Regarding the community’s opinions in the coding space, some held the idea to simplify JavaScript as an unnecessary add-on whilst some believed this new concept could revolutionize webpage coding by implementing simpler functions and commands that shortened one’s time to program
			</p>
			<p>
				Now you may be wondering, what does it mean when someone say it’s a language that ‘compiles’ to JavaScript. It simply refers to the process of taking computer code for a new program or language and transform this into a new language that can be understood by the computer, almost like a translation. </br> With Coffee script, it’s intention was to introduce new and simpler functions and variables to run lines of code that would work within Java Script’s domain. 
			</p>
			<p>
				It was very popular at the time when it was first introduced and some companies decided to  use the functions of CoffeeScript as a Dropbox, Pixel Game Maker MV.

			<h2> Who currently manages Coffee script? </h2>
			<p>
				Coffee Script is currently managed on a platform known as GitHub. On this platform, changes and updates are posted on a forum for the users to see, alongside other pages such as the ‘insights’ which provides statistics on which individuals have contributed to the product.</br>  However, not much information is provided on how the company is performing or attempting to move forward with the project.

			<h2> Some major features that were introduced with coffee script </h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Coffeescript code is about 55% less than the Javascript for the equivalent functionality.</br> That’s fewer cases programmers have to type and verify. </li>
				<li>Coffee script employs more limited syntax and hence is arguably simpler to manage in a big project.</br> It also allows more syntax measures and thus various programmers on the same project design their code much more simple. </li>
			</ul>

			<h2> The rapid decline of Coffee Script </h2>
			<p>
				Coffee Script as described by Stanley Z of ‘Hackermoon” referred to Coffee Script’s current state as “Completely dead on the market”.</br> Unfortunately, due to the large community surrounding JavaScript, the language had evolved and developed new ways to be more efficient with producing webpages.</br> This directly resulted in the popularity in Coffee Script from completely plummeting by 2017 due to its lack of ability to keep up with the evolution of JavaScript’s development in the coding space.</br>  Despite an attempt to reinvigorate the product in 2017, where “Coffee Script 2” was released onto the GITHUB repository.
